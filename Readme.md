This repository contains a variety of short scripts to recover space on a volume by compressing a variety of file types. Specific compression
utilities are used when available; for example, samtools is used to compress SAM files to BAM files.

Other scripts are available for deleting the same file types that were subjected to compression.

If you have any questions, please contact Scott Givan at givans@missouri.edu.
