This repository contains scripts to recover space on a volume by compressing a variety of file types encountered while working with next-generation DNA sequencing data. Optimized compression
utilities are used when available; for example, samtools is used to compress SAM files to BAM files.

Other scripts are available for deleting the same file types that were subjected to compression.
